Readme..

This project uses my own Everyblock developer ID, this will need replacing with your own.
The code is messy and needs refactoring.

To run the project open up a terminal, browse to folder containing the project.
Start up a server
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8001

Point a browser to localhost:8001

Data is slow to filter in and the requests eventually die because the recursive calls blow through the the JavaScript Stack.
